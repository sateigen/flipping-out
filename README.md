# Flipping Out

##### A series of graphical representations using data gained from flipping a coin 2<sup>n</sup> times.

###### The graphs include:
1. A line plot and scatter plot showing the difference between heads and tails at each recorded point.
2. A line plot and scatter plot showing the ratio between heads and tails at each recorded point.
3. A scatter plot of the mean heads/tails ratio at each recorded point.
4. A scatter plot of the standard deviation of the heads/tails ratio at each recorded point.
5. A histogram and box plot showing the ratio of the number of times heads was flipped to the total number of times the coin was flipped during 100,000 trials of 100 flips each.
6. A histogram and box plot showing the ratio of the number of times heads was flipped to the total number of times the coin was flipped during 100,000 trials of 1,000 flips each.

This program was created in a Jupyter Notebook and includes observations made after analyzing the data.
